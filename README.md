# BlackGarlic (WIP)
A fast, easy, and secure way to access i2p.
BlackGarlic intends to be an eqivalent to the Tor browser but for I2P. The hope is that it will increase usage of i2p, making the network faster, safer, and stronger as a whole.

## Goals
* easy
    * an average user should be able to use it
    * should require little to no technical knowledge to use
    * should be cross platform
* fast
    * should have no bloatware 
    * should be just as fast as using i2p like normal
* secure
    * open source
    * zero trust
    * advanced protections
